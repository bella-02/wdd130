      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Always a romance lover, Bella grew up reading books which whisked her away to new worlds full of drama and swoon-worthy confessions of love. She wished to create a space which welcomed all romantics through its doors, so the Blushing Book was born. This store had its humble beginnings as a book van, traveling to different areas to offer an on-the-go book shopping experience. However, there was potential for so much more. In 2020, amidst the pandemic, Bella decided it was time for The Blushing Book to find a permanent home. After much hard work, the doors to this dreamy store were opened to the world on November 3rd, 2021, and the rest has been history. </p>

       <p>The Blushing Book strives to be more than a store for its customers. We make book shopping into an experience. Comfortable lounge areas and many exciting events turns The Blushing Book into a place where readers can socialize with likeminded people. Once you’ve experienced the delightful atmosphere we offer, you will fall in love. Don’t believe us? Come visit and find out!</p>
