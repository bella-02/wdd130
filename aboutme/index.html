    <h2>Bella Hunt</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone! My name is Bella Hunt, and I am a Graphic Design major, minoring in Web Design. I am not sure what I specifically want to do with my career once I graduate, but I am greatly enjoying what I have learned so far. I look forward to the fact that my major is a job which I can reasonably work from home, which will be helpful when I decide to have children.</p>
    <p> I grew up with a military dad so I have moved all over the United States, but I currently live in Arizona. I enjoy anything creative, and love reading. I have a collection of over 250 books and my goal is to one day have a room dedicated to my books. I am the second oldest of 9 kids and have loved being able to grow up with so many siblings. I can't wait to learn with you all this semester! </p>
